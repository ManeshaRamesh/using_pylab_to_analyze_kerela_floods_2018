						<h6>Introduction</h6>
						<p>
							The summer of 2018 was the darkest moment in Kerala's past century of monsoon history. The region was flooded due to the heavy monsoons causing many deaths, injuries and leaving the region in a state of emergency. The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi announced a 500 crore relief package for relief and rehabilitation (Ahuja, 2018). 
						</p>
						<p>
							Analysing and recording annual rainfall patterns over a period time can be useful in predicting such emergencies. I decided to find data and analyze rainfall levels in Kerala as well as the neighbouring state Tamil Nadu (my birth place) to make conclusions about the fluctuating rainfall patterns over the years.

						<h6>Summary and Conclusions</h6>
						<p>
							The above data displays the average monthly precipitation (in mm) in the year of 2015 in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. I wanted to analyze the latest rainfall data in these Indian states to understand the rainfall dynamics of the regions practically and not just vicariously. However, the dataset that I used for this analysis did not go beyond 2015. 

							Kerala and Tamil Nadu are neighbouring states yet they experience rainfall at different times of the year. This is largely because of the geographic structure bordering the regions. In Kerala, precipitation is at its peek between June and July. On the other hand, precipitation is highest in October-December in Tamil Nadu. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This data makes sense because the relative levels of precipitation thourghout the year aligns with the onset and withdrawal of the monsoon winds in India. The southwest monsoons winds enter India at Kerala in the beginning of June, marked with an outburst of rainfall in the region.  Since Tamil Nadu is located on the leeward side of the monsoon winds, it does not recieve much rainfall during this time. The monsoon winds gradually start withdrawing from the sub-continent starting September. At this time rainfall in Kerala becomes sporadic and lowers. Whereas, Tamil Nadu (being on the windward side of the winds now) experiences high precipitation in the months of October and December. 
						</p>
						<p>
							However, the graph displays a small peak in rainfall around April and May in Tamil Nadu. February to early June is generally the driest time in this region. This could be a result of the growing effects of climate change. However, I would reveiew the data just in case. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Understanding the monsoons in these two states is important because they are both agrarian economies. Hence, recording and analysing the rainfall patterns in these two regions during the year can help make preparations for storing this natural source of water for irrigation purposes. This information is useful for farmers and also the Ministry of Agrciulture to take the necessary steps to soften the effects of any deviations or fluctuations.

						<h6>Summary and Conclusions</h6>
						<p>
							The above graph displays the trend of annual rainfall over a period of 15 years from 2001 to 2015. Several peeks in precipitaion can be observed during this time and with occasional drops in annual rainfall in years 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2012. There doesn't seem to be a net trend of increasing or decreasing precipitation. Perhaps over a larger period of time, a clearer trend could be observed. 
						</p>
						<p>
							According to a study, the annual preciptation levels in Kerala have been undergoing rythmic cycles of fluctuation and that there is no clear trend (Raju, 2005). The graphs seems to align with this trend with its multiple peaks. The average annual rainfall in Kerala over a period of 61 years is 3,107 mm. The peaks of the bars in this graph also seem to oscillate a but lower than the average. Nevertheless, considering that this is only the data for 15 years, the tiny deviation can be overlooked.
