# using_pylab_to_analyze_kerela_floods_2018

In this project, I used python to scrub some data and then used pylab to produce some relevant graphs. I analyzed those graphs and wrote some of my conclusions. 

The repository contains all the relevant files I worked with in the process of completing this project. The following website hosts the results.
